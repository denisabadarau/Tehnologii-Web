                    <p class="descriere"> 0 DAY ATTACK ON EARTH  is designed as a twin-stick shooter in its core, where the movement is done with
                         the left stick and shooting with the right.There is a main goal in each level, which is to take down a certain number of 
                         boss aliens before a timer goes down to zero. However, the skies are also filled with smaller ships, and there are pods 
                         and snakes that burst from the ground. Aiding the fight against the enemies are power-ups like spray gun and flame throwers,
                          as well as special abilities like nitro boost that helps moving the ship out of any harm.0 Day Attack on Earth consists of 
                          28 levels that are split in groups of seven that take place in four cities.Each city is accurately depicted through satellite 
                          imagery,containing landmarks like Champs-Élysées, Tokyo Tower, and Arc de Triomphe. One of the features included is co-op play 
                          for up to four players (when playing offline, AI-controlled ships will support the player instead). Besides co-op, there are 
                          Capture the Flag and Capture Point multiplayer modes.

                    <p class="descriere"> Most games in the Bomberman franchise largely revolve around two modes of play; single player campaigns where the player
                         must defeat enemies and reach an exit to progress through levels, and multiplayer modes where players must attempt to eliminate each other and be the 
                         last one standing. Gameplay involves strategically placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions after a certain amount of time, in order 
                         to destroy obstacles and kill enemies and other players. The player can pick up various power-ups, giving them benefits such as larger explosions or 
                         the ability to place more bombs down at a time. The player is killed if they touch an enemy or get caught up in a bomb's explosion, including their own, 
                         requiring players to be cautious of their own bomb placement. In addition to the main maze-based Bomberman games, some spin-off titles involve adventure, 
                         platformer, puzzle, and kart racing gameplay.</p>

Players start out with a number of workers and on a player’s turn, they will place one of their workers in any available location within that cell. Some of the locations provide players with resources (e.g., mRNA, ATP); some with actions (e.g., convert resources, collect cards). Resources are used to build enzymes, hormones and/or receptors, which score Health Points. The player with the most Health Points at the end of the game wins!</p>

                <p class="descriere">The simple strategy game at the core of Evo is made more interesting by the constantly changing climate. Positions which can be advantageous in one turn are often deadly a few turns later, so unlike many games where a winning player can come to dominate the game, the balance of power shifts frequently.

                <p class="descriere"> <b>Initiative :</b>  the order players will act in is determined by the number of "tail" mutations they have. Ties are resolved by roll-offs on a six-sided die.</p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Climate:</b>a six-sided die is rolled to determine how the climate changes. Normally it proceeds in a cycle from hot to cold and back again, but on a 5 it stays the same, and on a 6 it moves in the opposite direction to the expected one. </p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Movement and Combat:</b>  players can move their dinos. The more "leg" mutations they have, the further they can move their dinos. If they attempt to move into a space occupied by another dino, they must fight.</p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Birth:</b> players can add one new dino to the board for each "egg" mutation they possess, next to their existing dinos.</p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Survival and Mutation:</b>inos die off depending on climate and terrain. "Parasol" and "Fur" mutations allow them to withstand heat and cold, respectively. The players then bid for new mutations; their (successful) bids are subtracted from their score.</p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Meteor and Evolution:</b> In later turns, there is a chance that a Meteor strikes the island, ending the game. In earlier turns, and in later turns in which the game does not end, the players gain one point for each dino of their colour on the board.</p>
