                    <p class="descriere"> Wingspan is a competitive, medium-weight, card-driven, engine-building board game from Stonemaier Games.
                       You are bird enthusiasts—researchers, bird watchers, ornithologists, and collectors—seeking to discover and attract the best birds to your network of wildlife preserves. Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats (actions). </p>
                    <p class="subTitleGame" style="color:  #ffcc00">RULES:</p>
                    <p class="descriere"> <b>R1 :</b> Players can take a limited number of four types of action each round: drawing new birds, placing birds from their hand into their habitat, collecting food, and laying eggs, which have to be spent in order to play the birds</p>
                    <p class="descriere"> <b>R2:</b>The strength of each action depends on how many cards are already in that habitat, and additional bonus actions are activated by the birds which are already in the habitat which represents that action. </p>
                    <p class="descriere"> <b>R3:</b>In addition to putting birds into their habitats, players score points for objectives achieved during each round and throughout the whole game, eggs accumulated, and food and cards stored on other cards, which represent food collection and predation by a player's birds</p>
                    <p class="descriere"> <b>R4:</b>The winner is the player with the most points after 4 rounds.</p>

                <p class="descriere">The simple strategy game at the core of Evo is made more interesting by the constantly changing climate. Positions which can be advantageous in one turn are often deadly a few turns later, so unlike many games where a winning player can come to dominate the game, the balance of power shifts frequently.
                </p>
                <p class="subTitleGame" style="color:  #ffcc00">RULES:</p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Initiative :</b>  the order players will act in is determined by the number of "tail" mutations they have. Ties are resolved by roll-offs on a six-sided die.</p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Climate:</b>a six-sided die is rolled to determine how the climate changes. Normally it proceeds in a cycle from hot to cold and back again, but on a 5 it stays the same, and on a 6 it moves in the opposite direction to the expected one. </p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Movement and Combat:</b>  players can move their dinos. The more "leg" mutations they have, the further they can move their dinos. If they attempt to move into a space occupied by another dino, they must fight.</p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Birth:</b> players can add one new dino to the board for each "egg" mutation they possess, next to their existing dinos.</p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Survival and Mutation:</b>inos die off depending on climate and terrain. "Parasol" and "Fur" mutations allow them to withstand heat and cold, respectively. The players then bid for new mutations; their (successful) bids are subtracted from their score.</p>
                <p class="descriere"> <b>Meteor and Evolution:</b> In later turns, there is a chance that a Meteor strikes the island, ending the game. In earlier turns, and in later turns in which the game does not end, the players gain one point for each dino of their colour on the board.</p>
