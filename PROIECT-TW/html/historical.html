                    <p class="subTitleGame" style="color: green">DESCRIPTION:</p>
                        <p class="descriere"> The "Stone Age" times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective. In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. </p>
                        <p class="subTitleGame" style="color:  #ffcc00">RULES:</p>
