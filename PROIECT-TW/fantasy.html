                  <p> A game created by Games Workshop in the mid 80s that puts each player in the position of being an orcish general who must muster his troops into three battle lines in preparation of attacking the dwarves. Each player begins with a blank card mat which is slowly filled with cards that represent different units of orcs, goblins, war machines, and treasure. Each card has its own rules which affect play.</p>

                  <div id="descriere"> <b>R1 :</b> Once a battle line is completed with a standard at the front, a musician at the rear, and all the spaces filled in between, it can be used to disrupt another player's unfinished battle line. </div>

                  <div id="descriere"> <b>R3:</b> Each card has a point value which is then tallied and added to a bonus score for any completed battle lines.</div>

                  <p> Dark Tower was technologically impressive when it was released in 1981. Gameplay was facilitated by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself. Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors. The computer would play brief musical serenades at significant points of the game.</p>

                  <div id="descriere"> <b>R1 :</b> To vanquish the usurper, players search the four realms of the circular game board for three keys to unlock the tower's gate. </div>
                  <div id="descriere"> <b>R2:</b> On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.</div>
                  <div id="descriere"> <b>R3:</b> There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest. There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder. </div>
                  <div id="descriere"> <b>R4:</b> And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay siege to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.</div>
