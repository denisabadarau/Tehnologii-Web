                 <p class="subTitleGame">DESCRIPTION:</p>
                <p>Keep Cool is a board game created by Klaus Eisenack and Gerhard Petschel-Held of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and published by the German company Spieltrieb in November 2004. The game can be classified as both a serious game and a global warming game. In Keep Cool, up to six players representing the world's countries compete to balance their own economic interests and the world's climate in a game of negotiation. The goal of the game as stated by the authors is to "promote the general knowledge on climate change and the understanding of difficulties and obstacles, and "to make it available for a board game and still retain the major elements and processes." Empirical studies have shown that Keep Cool can facilitate experiential learning about the difficulties of international climate politics. </p>

                <p>The board game Kolejka (a.k.a. Queue) tells a story of everyday life in Poland at the tail-end of the Communist era. The players' task appears to be simple: They have to send their family members out to various stores on the game board to buy all the items on their shopping list. The problem is, however, that the shelves in the five neighborhood stores are empty. </p>

                <div id="descriere"> <b>R1 :</b> The players line up their pawns in front of the shops without knowing which shop will have a delivery. </div>
                <div id="descriere"> <b>R2:</b> To get ahead, the people in the queue use a range of queuing cards, such as "Mother carrying small child", "This is not your place, sir", or "Under-the-counter goods". But they have to watch out for "Closed for stocktaking", "Delivery error", and for the black pawns – the speculators – standing in the queue. </div>
                <div id="descriere"> <b>R3:</b>  Only those players who make the best use of the queuing cards in their hand will come home with full shopping bags.</div>

                <p> "Scrabble with math" is how this game is generally described, and the description is apt. The board is much like a Scrabble board, including spaces equivalent to "double-word score" and "triple-letter score". The difference is that, instead of placing words formed of letters, players of Equate place equations formed of numbers and symbols on the board. The beginners game (consisting mostly of addition and subtraction of integers) is pretty simple, but the standard game, bringing in multiplication, division, and fractions, can be something of a brain-burner. </p>
