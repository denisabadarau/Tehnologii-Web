                          <p> Welcome to the experiential table top game that is going to redefine what it means to play a game. Nyctophobia, which means "fear of the dark", is a cooperative game of survival in which up to four players must work together to escape a maniacal predator chasing them in a pitch-black forest. But there's a wrinkle: Would-be survivors play the game with blackout glasses. Players cannot see the board and have to rely on touch to navigate their way to safety. So, are you afraid of the dark?</p>
